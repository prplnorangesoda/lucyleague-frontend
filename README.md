This was created using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Development

```bash
npm i
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Note: in future, I'm planning on separating the API and frontend servers so you can run checks with the API without having to rebuild the frontend.
